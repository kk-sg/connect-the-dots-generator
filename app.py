    ## üîë Getting Your OpenAI API Key

    Before you can start generating cute images, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Here's how to get one:

    1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
    2. Sign up or log in: If you don't have an account, click "Sign up" and create one. If you already have an account, click "Log in".
    3. Navigate to API keys: Once logged in, look for your account name or icon in the top-right corner of the page. Click on it to open a dropdown menu.
    4. Select "Your Profile".
    5. Select "User API keys".
    6. Create a new API key: Look for a button that says "Create new secret key" or "+ New secret key".
    7. Name your key (optional): You may have the option to give your API key a name.
    8. Copy and save your API key: After creating the key, you'll see it displayed once. Make sure to copy it immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to see it again.
    9. Set up billing: Before you can use your API key, you need to set up billing. Look for a "Billing" or "Payment" section in the account settings or main menu.
    10. Set usage limits (optional): In the billing section, you may be able to set usage limits to control your spending.
